### A tool that automates the process of bumping multiple posts on facebook.
Given a list of permalinks (posts to bump) form a text file 
and the credentials of a fake account, this java program spawns a browser, with the help of selenium,
that acts as if a user is manually bumping someone's posts. And by bumping I mean leaving a comment, waiting a bit, and then deleting it.

### What is bumping?
Posts in facebook follow a "waterfall" pattern. Old, inactive posts are lost in this massive pool, among other posts. After a certain point the only way to view these posts, is to search for a key phrase in their description/content, or to endlessly scroll down. By leaving a comment in a facebook post, we engage some sort of activity, which drags this post up with the "fresh ones". That way more people can see this post/posts.
